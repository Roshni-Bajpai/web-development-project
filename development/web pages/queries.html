<h2 align="center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2></font>
<font face="Arial Black" size="+1" color="darkslateblue">
<p><b>1) Why should we wash hands frequently?<br></b></font>
<br>Ans: Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<br></p>
<font face="Arial Black" size="+1" color="darkslateblue">
<p><br><br>2) Why should we maintain social-distancing?<br></font>
<br>Ans: We should <b>maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</b>
because when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.<br>
<font face="Arial Black" size="+1" color="darkslateblue">
<p><br><br>3) Do 5G mobile networks spread COVID-19?<br></font>
<br>Ans: Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.
COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose.</p><br>
<font face="Arial Black" size="+1" color="darkslateblue">
<p><br><br>4) Do exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)?<br></font>
<br>Ans: You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.</p><br>
<font face="Arial Black" size="+1" color="darkslateblue">
<p><br><br>5) Does drinking alcohol protect you against COVID-19?<br></font>
<br>Ans: Drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous. Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems.
<font face="Arial Black" size="+1" color="darkslateblue">
<p><br><br>6) Can mosquitoes spread corona virus?<br></font>
<br>Ans: To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.
<font face="Arial Black" size="+1" color="darkslateblue">
<p><br><br>7) Does the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?<br></font>
<br>Ans: People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.</p><br>
<font face="Arial Black" size="+1" color="darkslateblue">
<p><br><br>8) What are the helpline numbers in India for covid-19?<br></font>
<br>Ans: National helpline numbers in India provided by the government are 011-23978046 and 1075.
